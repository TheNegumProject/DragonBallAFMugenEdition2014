-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Why did I make a totally overused Vegeta? Well one thing is was the
only character that I had enough sprites of. He was also a good medium
for some of my combos. 

Also people ask "Why 'PracVegeta'?" (Practice Vegeta). Well I intended
not to release him and just practice programming. He turned out better
than planned and I released him.

2. What moves does he have?

A: Punch
B: Elbow
C: Uppercut
X: "Trust kick"
Y: Side kick
Z: Knee

all of his specials follow a pattern because there is a lesser form 
(usually D, DF, F) and a greater form (usually D, DB, B or D, DB, Bx2).

D, DF, F, A           = tri-kick
D, DB, B, A           = multi-kick
D, DF, F, B           = Elbow smash
D, DB, B, B           = Repeated Elbow Smash
D, DF, F, C           = Smack down
D, DB, B, D, DB, B, C = Take down
D, DF, F, X           = "Around the world" combo
D, DB, B, D, DB, B, X = "All over the place" combo
D, DF, F, Y           = ki shot
start                 = SUPER RENZOKU ENERGY DAN (oh yeah)
B + C                 = Zanzoken
Y + Z                 = Zanzoken punch
D, DF, F, Z           = Zanzoken combo
D, DB, B, D, DB, B, Z = Boost mode

Rage: 
Their is a rage bar as it fills you gain more defence and attack. When
it is full you will lose control and perform one of several 
"Rage Snaps".

Rage Snaps:
Renzoku Energy Dan: You may remember this from the previous version.
Trust me you won't escape... his wrath.
Must have: 100+ health and 2000+ power

Super Meteo Combo: Vegeta will attempt to attack you. This can be 
blocked and he loses his energy gain if this move is performed.
Must have: 100+ health and less than 2000 power, but greater than 1000

PermaBoost: Vegeta is set into Boost Mode and there is no drain on his
energy. He cannot switch out as well. He can still perform other rage 
snaps.
Must have: 100+ health and less than 1000 power

Energy Rain: Vegeta is about to unleash some hell. He rains energy 
bombs that explode on ground impact. There is no excape (well there is 
but...). You'll probably die if your caught in this.
Must have: less than 100 health

End of Rage Snaps

The new Super Renzoku Energy Dan:
After pressing start Vegeta will get into a charge possition. 
Press...
A: to fire
B: to cancel getting back all energys charged into the move
C: to zanzoken costs 250 power
X: to charge Health into the move
Y: to charge Energy into the move
Z: to charge Rage into the move
Any direction: to fly around during the charge. You cannot move while
chargeing all 3 Rage, Health, and Energy; you can move while charging
only 2 though. If your hit you lose the energys chaged in.

Super chaining:
The super chains don't use the same buttons as they do up there, and I
won't tell you what they are either. I'll give you a hint they are 
some button + another button. It can only be done during the zanzoken 
combo.

Beam Finishers:
They can be done after every special move, except renzoku, ki shot, 
zanzoken, boost mode and most of the "Rage Snaps". Just hold a button 
(or set of buttons) during the move to use them. (They aren't just 
a, b, c, x, y, or z.... MWAHAHAHAHAHA)

3. Who helped me? (the Thanks section)
Thanks to

Cyanide: for answering questons I had on moves when I got stuck
Necromancer and Majita: for helping me with the Renzoku code
Blackshinobi: for helping me with the AI Anti fly (hey that rhymes)
Rellik: for the sprite sheet
Red Spider: for the great sounds
And last but probably the most important Goten88: for teaching how to
program (even though I watched him make one move and basiclly knew what
to do from there).

(after Version 1)
Necromancer and Sunboy: for the suggestions
Necromancer and Majita: for help improving the renzoku code (thx 
again guys)
Necromancer, Majita, Thrawn, and The Spectator: The founders of the 
Rage code.
(is it me or is Necro THE man?)

4. The update section
Version 1.1

-Rage code
-Added super chaining
-Added new effects to intro
-All required sprites in
-removed attack sound from every move
-fixed tired anim after renzoku (I think)
-changed regular attack chaining
-added beam finishers
-improved renzoku code
-super meteo combo added

5. Known bugs...

The rage bar doesn't change vertical position.. (probably because it's
a helper). Also it may move kinda "slow" sideways.

Otherwise I don't know of any I think. Bug reports welcome...
sockboybc@hotmail.com  reviews welcome too.

Also there is a stolen character by bardockssj (I think) called
Majin Vegeta... that's mine with a few things by other creators.
Of course that is the previous 1.0 version.
